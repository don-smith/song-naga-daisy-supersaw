## Planned Features

- **Supersaw Oscillator** modelled on the Roland JP-8000  
- **DRIFT** and **SHIFT** knobs adjust supersaw detune and amount of effect
- **Suboscillator** that can be mixed in with the main main signal via the **GROWL** knob.  Waveform and octave can be selected while in ALT MODE by adjusting the **GROWL** knob.    
- **Variable State, Variable Pole Filter** can be controlled by the **HOWL** section, including Frequency Control via the **HOWL** knob, resonance via the "R" knob, and drive with the "D" knob.  Filter type can be changed by entering ALT MODE and adjusting the **HOWL** knob.  Number of Poles can be set by entiring ALT MODE and adjusting the "R" knob in the **HOWL** section.  
- **Amplifier** with its own **dedicated envelope** and volume control.  Overall volume can be set via the **CLAWS** knob.  Envelope can be adjusted by entering ALT MODE and adjusting the A, S, and R knobs in the **POUNCE** section.  Envelope modulation amount can be adjusted by setting the **CLAWS** knob while in ALT MODE.  
- **Routable Modulation Envelope** can modulate **DRIFT**, **SHIFT** and Filter Cutoff.
- **Routable LFO** can modulate **DRIFT,** **SHIFT,** Filter Cutoff, or the Amp.  LFO Rate can be set via the **SLITHER** knob and LFO Waveform can be set via the **SLITHER** knob while in ALT MODE.  
- **FANGS** section provides rich stereo effects including echo, chorus, delay, flanger, and reverb.
- **Full MIDI Control** of all parameters via USB-over-MIDI input.  USB also powers the Instrument.  
- **6 Note Polyphony**  
- **Stereo Output**  

### About the Supersaw Oscillator  
The Supersaw Oscillator used in **Takshaka** is based on the thesis ["How to Emulate the Super Saw"](https://forum.orthogonaldevices.com/uploads/short-url/rLjREzRcZvvK2527rFnTGvuwY1b.pdf) written by Adam Szabo in 2010.
